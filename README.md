# GitHub Pages + Jekyll Portfolio Starter (Minimal Theme)

This is a ready-to-publish portfolio using **GitHub Pages** with the official **jekyll-theme-minimal**.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a repo named** `YOURUSERNAME.github.io` on GitHub.
2. Download this starter and push the files to that repo.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and ensure "Deploy from branch" is enabled on `main`.
4. Your site will be live at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io` within a minute.

## Customize

- Edit `_config.yml` → set `title`, `description`, `logo`, social handles.
- Edit `index.md` → update intro, links, and featured projects.
- Add or edit project pages in `projects/` (each is a Markdown page).
- Put images in `assets/img/` and reference them like `/assets/img/your-image.png`.

## Tips

- Convert notebooks to static images or HTML snippets and link to the full notebook on GitHub or nbviewer.
- Keep pages short and focused; link to repos, demos, and PDFs.
- Optional: add a `CNAME` file with your custom domain to use it here.
